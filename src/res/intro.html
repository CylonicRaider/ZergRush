<p>Evil Zergs are attacking your base! Defend it at any cost!</p>
<p>Your goal is to have yourself (the green triangle) and your base (the blue
circle) survive for the longest amount of time in spite of the onslaught of
the Zergs (red squares).</p>
<p>You (and the base) lose health by battling (via touching) Zergs, who lose
health from the battle as well. You can restore your health by touching the
base; the base itself does not regenerate.</p>
